BODY and BODYSTRUCTURE parsing fixes (#58) [API CHANGE]
-------------------------------------------------------
The response values for BODY and BODYSTRUCTURE responses may include a
sequence of tuples which are not separated by whitespace. These should
be treated as a single item (a list of multiple arbitrarily nested
tuples) but IMAPClient was treating them as separate items. IMAPClient
now returns these tuples in a list to allow for consistent parsing.

A BODYSTRUCTURE response for a multipart email with 2 parts would have
previously looked something like this::

  (('text', 'html', ('charset', 'us-ascii'), None, None, 'quoted-printable', 55, 3),
   ('text', 'plain', ('charset', 'us-ascii'), None, None, '7bit', 26, 1), 
   'mixed', ('boundary', '===============1534046211=='))

The response is now returned like this::

  ([
     ('text', 'html', ('charset', 'us-ascii'), None, None, 'quoted-printable', 55, 3),
     ('text', 'plain', ('charset', 'us-ascii'), None, None, '7bit', 26, 1) 
   ], 
   'mixed', ('boundary', '===============1534046211=='))

The behaviour for single part messages is unchanged. In this case the
first element of the tuple is a string specifying the major content
type of the message (eg "text"). 

An is_multipart boolean property now exists on BODY and BODYSTRUCTURE
responses to allow the caller to easily determine whether the response
is for a multipart message.

Code that expects the previous response handling behaviour needs to be
updated.

Live tests converted to use unittest2 (#4)
------------------------------------------
livetest.py now uses the unittest2 package to run the tests. This
provides much more flexibility that the custom approach that was used
before. Dependencies between tests are gone - each test uses a fresh
IMAP connection and is preceeded by the same setup.

unittest2.main() is used to provide a number of useful command line
options and the ability to run a subset of tests.

IMAP account parameters are now read using a configuration file
instead of command line arguments. See livetest-sample.ini for an
example.

Added NAMESPACE support (#63)
-----------------------------
namespace() method added and get_folder_delimiter() has been deprecated.

===============
 Version 0.6.2
===============

Square brackets in responses now parsed correctly (#55)
-------------------------------------------------------
This fixes response handling for FETCH items such as 
``BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (from subject)]``.

Example moved (#56)
-------------------
The example has been moved to imapclient/examples directory and is
included when the IMAPClient is installed from PyPI.

Distribute (#57)
----------------
The project is now packaged using Distribute instead of
setuptools. There should be no real functional change.

===============
 Version 0.6.1
===============

Python SSL bug patch
--------------------
Automatically patch a bug in imaplib which can cause hangs when using
SSL (Python Issue 5949). The patch is only applied when the running
Python version is known to be affected by the problem.

Doc update
----------
Updated the README to better reflect the current state of the project.

=============
 Version 0.6
=============

New response parser (#1, #45)
-----------------------------
Command response lexing and parsing code rewritten from stratch to
deal with various bugs that surfaced when dealing with more complex
responses (eg. BODYSTRUCTURE and ENVELOPE). This change also fixes
various problems when interacting with Gmail and MS Exchange. 

XLIST extension support (#25) [NEW]
-----------------------------------
Where the server supports it, xlist_folders() will return a mapping of
various common folder names to the actual server folder names. Gmail's
IMAP server supports this.

Added COPY command support (#36) [NEW]
--------------------------------------
New copy() method.
 
Added interact.py [NEW]
-----------------------
A script for interactive IMAPClient sessions. Useful for debugging and
exploration. Uses IPython if installed.

Full SELECT response (#24) [API CHANGE]
---------------------------------------
select_folder() now returns a dictionary with the full (parsed) SELECT
command response instead of just the message count.

Full list responses (#24) [API CHANGE]
--------------------------------------
The return value from list_folders(), list_sub_folders() and
xlist_folders() now include the IMAP folder flags and delimiter.

Folder name character encoding (#21) [API CHANGE]
-------------------------------------------------
Bytes that are greater than 0x7f in folder names are will cause an
exception when passed to methods that accept folder name arguments
because there is no unambigous way to handle these. Callers should
encode such folder names to unicode objects first.

Folder names are now always returned as unicode objects.

Message sequence number now always returned in FETCH responses
--------------------------------------------------------------
Fetch responses now include a "SEQ" element which gives the message
(non-UID) sequence number. This allows for easy mapping between UIDs
and standard sequence IDs.

Folder name handling fixes (#28, #42)
-------------------------------------
Various folder name handling bugs fixed.


===============
 Version 0.5.2
===============

Folder name quoting and escaping fixes (#28)
--------------------------------------------
Correctly handle double quotes and backslashes in folder names when
parsing LIST and LSUB responses.

Fixed fetch literal handling (#33)
----------------------------------
Fixed problem with parsing responses where a literal followed another
literal.


===============
 Version 0.5.1
===============

License change
--------------
Changed license from GPL to new BSD.

=============
 Version 0.5
=============

SSL support
-----------
Support for SSL based connections by passing ssl=True when
constructing an IMAPClient instance.

Transparent folder encoding
---------------------------
Folder names are now encoded and decoded transparently if required
(using modified UTF-7). This means that any methods that return folder
names may return unicode objects as well as normal strings [API
CHANGE]. Additionally, any method that takes a folder name now accepts
unicode object too. Use the folder_encode attribute to control whether
encode/decoding is performed.

Unquoted folder name handling fix
---------------------------------
Unquoted folder names in server responses are now handled
correctly. Thanks to Neil Martinsen-Burrell for reporting this bug.

Fixed handling of unusual characters in folder names
----------------------------------------------------
Fixed a bug with handling of unusual characters in folder names.

Timezone handling [API CHANGE]
------------------------------
Timezones are now handled correctly for datetimes passed as input and for
server responses. This fixes a number of bugs with timezones. Returned
datetimes are always in the client's local timezone.

More unit tests
---------------
Many more unit tests added, some using Michael Foord's excellent
mock.py.  (http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/)
