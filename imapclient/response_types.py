    ENVELOPE responses.

    :ivar date: A datetime instance that represents the "Date" header.
    :ivar subject: A string that contains the "Subject" header.
    :ivar from\_: A tuple of Address objects that represent one or more
      addresses from the "From" header, or None if header does not exist.
    :ivar sender: As for from\_ but represents the "Sender" header.
    :ivar reply_to: As for from\_ but represents the "Reply-To" header.
    :ivar to: As for from\_ but represents the "To" header.
    :ivar cc: As for from\_ but represents the "Cc" header.
    :ivar bcc: As for from\_ but represents the "Bcc" recipients.
    :ivar in_reply_to: A string that contains the "In-Reply-To" header.
    :ivar message_id: A string that contains the "Message-Id" header.

    A particular issue to watch out for is IMAP's handling of "group
    syntax" in address fields. This is often encountered as a
    recipient header of the form::

        undisclosed-recipients:;

    but can also be expressed per this more general example::

        A group: a@example.com, B <b@example.org>;

    This example would yield the following Address tuples::

      Address(name=None, route=None, mailbox=u'A group', host=None)
      Address(name=None, route=None, mailbox=u'a', host=u'example.com')
      Address(name=u'B', route=None, mailbox=u'b', host=u'example.org')
      Address(name=None, route=None, mailbox=None, host=None)

    The first Address, where ``host`` is ``None``, indicates the start
    of the group. The ``mailbox`` field contains the group name. The
    final Address, where both ``mailbox`` and ``host`` are ``None``,
    indicates the end of the group.

    See :rfc:`3501#section-7.4.2` and :rfc:`2822` for further details.

    As an example, an address header that looks like::

        Mary Smith <mary@foo.com>
